Auxiliary Space -> "extra space" or "temporary space" used by an algorithm.

Space complexity of an algorithm -> total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size.
space complexity includes both auxiliary space and space used by input.

space c = aux space + input (required space)

ex. if we want to compare standard sorting algorithms on the basis of space, then auxiliary space would be better criteria than space complexity.

    merge sort uses -> O(n) aux space
    Insertion sort & Heap sort -> O(1) aux space.

    space complexity of both algo -> O(n).

for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
     for (int j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
          // any operation which takes time t
     }
     i = i + k ;
}

/*
    The final Keyword in Java behaves differently when used with classes, methods, and variables.

    IMP - final keyword in Java :

    Once any data member (a variable, method, or class) gets declared as final, it can only be assigned once.
    The final variable cannot be reinitialized with another value.
    A final method cannot be overridden by another method.
    A final class cannot be extended or inherited by another child class.

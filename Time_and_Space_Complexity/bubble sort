worst and avg case time complexity : O(n * n)  //when array is reverse sorted

best case time complexity : O(n) // when array is already sorted.

auxiliary space : o(1)

Boundary cases : bubble sort takes minimum time (Order of n) when elem are already sorted.

sorting in place : yes
stable : yes
